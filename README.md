# Ecodomia

Start from humble beginnings and slowly build a whole town and power up your character.

* Numbers, tables, chairs, fence, grass & flowers made by me


<!-- TODOs: 
NEXT:
* Invest in marketing to speed up how fast and how many bunnies come to the checkout
* Maybe randomly spawn gold bunnies that take 10 carrots and pay 15 moneys? To prevent carrots stacking up more and more over time


EVENTUALLY:
* Unify all move-y prefabs (cargo, money) in some reasonable way
* Maybe move the whole sales process into a single script that takes the areas as input?
