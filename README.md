# Ecodomia

Start from humble beginnings and slowly build a whole town and power up your character.

## How to play
Collect carrots, put them on the table and sit in the sales chair to sell them to bunnies. Collect money and spend it on upgrades.

* Pick up furniture by holding SPACE
* See furniture stats by holding ALT

<!-- TODOs: 
NEXT:
* Add a warehouse where you can collect placeable items that you can put around your house
* Make house-size upgradeable
* Create an upstairs environment with a trick where if you walk up the stairs it switches the tiles to being upstairsy

* Invest in marketing to speed up how fast and how many bunnies come to the checkout
* Maybe randomly spawn gold bunnies that take 10 carrots and pay 15 moneys? To prevent carrots stacking up more and more over time

* Add new industries (squirrel lumberjacks to build new houses to spawn important NPCs, maybe hedgehog miners)

* Add minigames - racing, dodging bullet-hell, ..?

EVENTUALLY:
* Unify all move-y prefabs (cargo, money) in some reasonable way
* Maybe move the whole sales process into a single script that takes the areas as input?
