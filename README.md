# Ecodomia

Start from humble beginnings and slowly build a whole town and power up your character.

* Numbers, tables, chairs, fence, grass & flowers made by me


<!-- TODOs: 
NEXT:
* Give player something to do while first automation runs? Maybe a second stand you can buy for cheap?

* Somehow move carrot-balance such that you need 2 extra spawners and 2 collector bunnies to fully supply your table
  * Maybe randomly spawn gold bunnies that take 10 carrots and pay 15 moneys? To prevent carrots stacking up more and more over time
* Add upgrader for opening a second table


EVENTUALLY:
* Unify all move-y prefabs (cargo, money) in some reasonable way
* Maybe move the whole sales process into a single script that takes the areas as input?
