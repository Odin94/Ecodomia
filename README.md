# Ecodomia

Start from humble beginnings and slowly build a whole town and power up your character.

<!-- TODOs: 
NEXT:
* Add a warehouse where you can collect placeable items that you can put around your house
* Make house-size upgradeable
* Create an upstairs environment with a trick where if you walk up the stairs it switches the tiles to being upstairsy

* Invest in marketing to speed up how fast and how many bunnies come to the checkout
* Maybe randomly spawn gold bunnies that take 10 carrots and pay 15 moneys? To prevent carrots stacking up more and more over time


EVENTUALLY:
* Unify all move-y prefabs (cargo, money) in some reasonable way
* Maybe move the whole sales process into a single script that takes the areas as input?
