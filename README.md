# Ecodomia

Start from humble beginnings and slowly build a whole town and power up your character.

* Numbers, tables, chairs, fence, grass & flowers made by me


<!-- TODOs: 
NEXT:
* More carrot spawners
* Invest in marketing to speed up how fast and how many bunnies come to the checkout
* Add gate you can open to unlock new area with many, many carrots (so you need to automate your stuff through)
  * Maybe make automation for 2nd sales point much more expensive to encourage deferring that to after opening the door?

* Somehow move carrot-balance such that you need 2 extra spawners and 2 collector bunnies to fully supply your table
  * Maybe randomly spawn gold bunnies that take 10 carrots and pay 15 moneys? To prevent carrots stacking up more and more over time
* Add upgrader for opening a second table


EVENTUALLY:
* Unify all move-y prefabs (cargo, money) in some reasonable way
* Maybe move the whole sales process into a single script that takes the areas as input?
